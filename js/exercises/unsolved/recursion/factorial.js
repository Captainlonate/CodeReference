/*
    Write a function factorial which accepts 
    a number and returns the factorial of that 
    number. A factorial is the product of an 
    integer and all the integers below it; 
    e.g., factorial four 4! is equal to 24, 
    because 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 
    equals 24. factorial zero (0!) 
    is always 1.

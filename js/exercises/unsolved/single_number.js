/*
    LeetCode question:
    https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/

    Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one.
    Find that single one.

    You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
    (You can't use sets, or objects)
    And you can't loop twice.
*/

var singleNumber = function(nums) {
    
};

// ===================================================

console.log(singleNumber([4, 1, 2, 1, 2]) === 4)
console.log(singleNumber([2,2,1]) === 1)

## Some Commands

**npm list**

```bash
# List which version of a package is currently installed.
# Note that create-react-app installed this. Even though you did
#   not explicitly install this, it will still list some version.
#   Example: @testing-library/user-event@13.5.0
npm list @testing-library/user-event
```

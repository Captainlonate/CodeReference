## Install rust using rustup

* Go [Here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
* Install the rustup.exe file (or use curl on a mac)
* Run the .exe
* Choose default stuff (1)
* This should automatically add the bin folder to PATH
* Open a new terminal, try `rustc --version` and you'll know if it was added to PATH or not.

## What is installed

Within ~/.cargo/bin you'll find `rustc`, `cargo` and `rustup`.

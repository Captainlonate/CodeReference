# awk Command

_`awk` considers space delimited words to be separate fields by default._

_Awk is abbreviated from the names of the developers â€“ Aho, Weinberger, and Kernighan._

### Just print the contents of a file

```bash
awk '{print}' sample_text.txt
# Is the same as cat sample_text.txt
```

### Print the first field of each line

You can use `$0`, `$1`, `$2`, etc. Again, it's looking for spaces to delimit fields by default.

```bash
# Apple, Dell, Dell, Lenovo
awk '{print $1}' sample_text.txt
```

### Print more than one field, each separated by a space

```bash
awk '{print $1,$3}' sample_text.txt
```

### Operate on the output of another command

```bash
ls -l | awk '{print $1}'
```

### Print the last field of each line

_`$NF` means number of fields, which means "the last field" basically_

```bash
awk '{print $NF}' sample_text.txt
```

### Use a different delimiter

_`awk` looks for spaces to delimit each field, per line. But you can change it to use a different delimiter. Use `-F',' to use commas`_

```bash
# Use commas instead of spaces
awk -F',' '{print $1}' sample_text.txt
```
